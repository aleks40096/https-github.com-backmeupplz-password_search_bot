  <b>Password Search</b> allows you to quickly and efficiently find unmasked plain text passwords that were leaked to the Internet. Just send me an email address and I will respond with the list of the leaked passwords in plain text after email verification. You can change the language with the /language command.

  You will receive a message with 6 digits to your email from <code>noreply@passwordsear.ch</code>, please, check the spam folder as well. Never tell this code to anyone but me. Send these 6 digits to me and I will respond with the passwords.
